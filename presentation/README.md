## 🎯 Motivation

### The Quantum Threat
- **Current State**: Modern cryptography relies on computational hardness assumptions
- **RSA & ECC**: Based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems
- **Quantum Threat**: These assumptions break down with quantum computers
- **Timeline**: "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks are already a concern
- **Urgency**: Need quantum-resistant solutions before large-scale quantum computers exist

### Why This Matters
- Financial systems rely on RSA/ECC for secure transactions
- Government communications need long-term security guarantees
- Internet infrastructure (TLS/SSL) vulnerable to quantum attacks
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency security at risk

## ⚛️ Shor's Algorithm: The Game Changer

### Overview
- **Discovered**: Peter Shor (1994)
- **Impact**: Polynomial-time quantum algorithm for integer factorization
- **Breaks**: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography

### How It Works
1. **Reduction**: Factoring N → Finding period of f(x) = aˣ mod N
2. **Quantum Period Finding**: Uses Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
3. **Superposition**: Evaluate function for all x simultaneously
4. **Interference**: Extract period through constructive/destructive interference
5. **Classical Post-processing**: Use period to find factors with high probability

### Complexity Comparison
- **Classical (Best Known)**: O(exp((log N)^(1/3) (log log N)^(2/3)))
- **Shor's Algorithm**: O((log N)³)
- **Impact**: Exponential → Polynomial time

### Threat to Current Systems
- **RSA**: Completely broken by Shor's algorithm
- **Elliptic Curve**: Vulnerable to modified Shor's (ECDLP)
- **Diffie-Hellman**: Discrete log problem also solvable
- **Timeline Estimate**: 10-30 years until cryptographically relevant quantum computers

## 🔷 Lattice Methods (Deep Dive)

### What is a Lattice?
A discrete subgroup of ℝⁿ generated by linear combinations of basis vectors with integer coefficients.

**Mathematical Definition**:
```
L = {Σ aᵢbᵢ : aᵢ ∈ ℤ}
```
where b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ are linearly independent basis vectors.

- **Quantum Resistance**: No known efficient quantum algorithm

#### Closest Vector Problem (CVP)
- **Goal**: Given point t, find closest lattice point
- **Complexity**: NP-hard
- **Quantum Resistance**: Also believed quantum-hard

### Learning With Errors (LWE)

**Problem Definition**: Given (A, b = As + e) where:
- A: random matrix
- s: secret vector
- e: small error vector

**Goal**: Recover secret s

**Key Properties**:
- Provable reduction from worst-case lattice problems
- Versatile: supports encryption, signatures, advanced primitives
- Quantum-resistant: no known quantum advantage

### Ring-LWE
- **Structured variant**: Uses polynomial rings for efficiency

## 🔐 NTRU Cryptosystem

### Overview
- **Developed**: 1996 (Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman)
- **Type**: Lattice-based, predates LWE
- **Basis**: Polynomial rings and NTRU lattices

### How NTRU Works

**Key Generation**:
1. Choose random polynomials f, g in ring R
2. Compute h = g/f (mod q)
3. Public key: h; Private key: f

**Encryption**:
- Ciphertext: c = r·h + m (mod q)
- r: random polynomial (blinding factor)
- m: message polynomial

**Decryption**:
- Compute f·c (mod q)
- Recover m using private key structure

### NTRU Advantages
- Very fast operations
- Reasonably small keys
- Simple structure
- Long history of cryptanalysis (more confidence)

### NTRU in Modern PQC
- FALCON uses NTRU lattices
- Influenced design of Ring-LWE schemes
- Still competitive with newer lattice methods

## 🌌 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

### Fundamental Difference from PQC
- **PQC**: Classical algorithms resistant to quantum attacks
- **QKD**: Uses quantum mechanics itself for key distribution
- **Security Basis**: Laws of physics (quantum mechanics) vs computational assumptions

### BB84 Protocol (Bennett-Brassard 1984)

**Setup**:
- Alice wants to send key to Bob
- Quantum channel + authenticated classical channel

**Steps**:
1. **Transmission**: Alice sends random qubits in random bases (rectilinear/diagonal)
2. **Measurement**: Bob measures in random bases
3. **Basis Reconciliation**: Alice/Bob publicly compare bases, keep matching ones
4. **Eavesdropping Check**: Compare subset of bits to detect interference
5. **Privacy Amplification**: Generate final secure key

**Security**: Eavesdropping disturbs quantum states (no-cloning theorem), detectable by Alice/Bob

### E91 Protocol (Ekert 1991)

**Foundation**: Entanglement and Bell inequalities

**Steps**:
1. **Entanglement Source**: Generate EPR pairs, send to Alice and Bob
2. **Measurement**: Each measures in different bases
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Check Bell inequality violations
4. **Eavesdropping Detection**: Violation indicates no eavesdropper
5. **Key Extraction**: Correlated measurement outcomes become shared key

**Advantages**:
- Security from entanglement itself
- Doesn't require trusting the source (device-independent QKD possible)
- Bell test provides built-in security verification

**Security Principle**: 
- Perfect correlations in entangled states
- Any interception breaks correlations, violates Bell inequalities
- Mathematically proven security based on quantum mechanics
